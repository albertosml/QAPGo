# QAPGo

Here, I want to show how I have resolved the QAP problem in two different versions:

- In the first one, I have a file called `qap_dirty_version.go`, where I have all the code, that runs the problem.

- In the another version, I have a `main.go` file, where I can run the app, and then, this file calls to all files available at `src` folder.
